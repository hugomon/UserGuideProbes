\GB\Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) over UDP\P\

The protocol used to set up voice communications for Voice-over-IP (VOIP), as described in \u2=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt\RFC 3261\p0\. This probe sends a SIP request in a single UDP packet and checks for a valid SIP response.

By default, this probe sends an OPTIONS command to the target device. However, some VOIP systems do not answer un-authenticated OPTIONS requests. For these devices, change the command to REGISTER.

\b\Parameters\p\

\i\URI\p\ - The SIP uniform resource identifier in the request.

\i\Command\p\ - The SIP command to send in the request.
