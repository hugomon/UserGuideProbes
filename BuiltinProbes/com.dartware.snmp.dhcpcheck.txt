\i\Scope\p\ - The DHCP scope to check (e.g., "192.168.1.0").

\i\Free Lease Warning\p\ - The number of remaining leases at which the device enters WARNING state.

\i\Free Lease Alarm\p\ - The number of free leases remaining at which the device enters ALARM state.

\i\Free Lease Critical\p\ - The number of free leases remaining at which the device enters CRITICAL state.

\i\View the DHCP scope table\p\ - Click to view a list of available scopes, along with information about in-use lease, free lease, and pending offers.
