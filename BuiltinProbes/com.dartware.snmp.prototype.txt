\GB\Prototype SNMP Probe\P\

This probe demonstrates an InterMapper SNMP probe. Many of these features are described in \i\Creating Your Own Probes\p\, in the \u2=http://www.intermapper.com/docs/developer/index.html\Developer Guide\P0\. If you have questions about this probe, \u2=mailto:support@intermapper.com\please contact us.\p0\

This probe probably isn't useful for production work, but provides examples of techniques available in custom SNMP probes.

The probe demonstrates how to retrieve SNMP values from a device by specifying their OIDs and how to display those values in the device's Status Window. 

The probe also provides thresholds that set the device into \b\Alarm\p\ or \b\Warning\p\ state. 

In this example, the device goes into \b\Alarm\p\ or \b\Warning\p\ state if it has been rebooted recently (controlled by the \i\RebootAlarm\p\ and \i\RebootWarn\p\ parameters - two and three minutes, by default) or if there aren't as many interfaces in the ifTable as specified (in the \i\ExpectedInterfaces\p\ parameter.)

The parameters are:

\i\RebootAlarm\p\ - set the device to \b\Alarm\p\ if the sysUptime is less than the specified value in minutes.

\i\RebootWarn\p\ - set the device to \b\Warning\p\ if the sysUptime is less than the specified value in minutes.

\i\ExpectedInterfaces\p\ - set the device to \b\Warning\p\ if the the ifNumber is greater than or equal to this value.

This probe also demonstrates:

* \b\CALCULATION variables\p\ - converts from centi-seconds (hundredths of a second) to seconds.

* \b\Formatting of the Status Window\p\ - in the \m\<snmp-device-display>\g\ section.

* \b\Marking up text\p\ - in the \m\<description>\g\ and \m\<snmp-device-display>\g\ sections, using IMML (InterMapper Markup Language) to get bold, italic, colored text, etc. 

* IMML also allows you to create a link to a URL, using the \\U2=http://xxxx\\ notation shown in the \m\<snmp-device-display>\g\ section.

-- Parameters are user-settable values that the probe uses for its comparisons.
-- Specify the default values here. The customer can change them and they will be retained for each device.

<parameters>
	"RebootAlarm"		=	"2" 	-- 2 min = 120 seconds = 12,000 centi-seconds
	"RebootWarn"		=	"3" 	-- 3 min = 180 seconds = 18,000 centi-seconds
	"ExpectedInterfaces" =	"3" 	-- expected number of interfaces
</parameters>

-- SNMP values to be retrieved from the device, and 
-- Specify the variable name, its OID, a format (usually DEFAULT) and a short description.
-- CALCULATION variables are computed from other values already retrieved from the device.
