\GB\SNMP - Cisco N5000 with FEX Traffic\P\

This probe provides Basic SNMP Traffic probe functionality for the Nexus 5000 with Fiber Extender (FEX). The standard SNMP Traffic probe does not show the Fiber Extender's interfaces, so this probe incorporates special logic to retrieve that information.

This probe requires InterMapper Server version 5.6.6 or newer, which uses the special logic described above; otherwise, the speeds displayed for high speed interfaces are not shown correctly.

\b\Parameters\p\

None.
