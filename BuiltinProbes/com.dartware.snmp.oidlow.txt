\GB\SNMP Low Threshold\P\

This probe retrieves a single SNMP MIB variable and compares it to the specified thresholds below. If the value goes below any of the specified thresholds, the device changes to the specified state.

\b\Parameters\p\

\i\Variable\p\ - the MIB name or OID to retrieve. If you have imported the MIB for this device, enter the symbolic name for this value. Otherwise, enter its OID. 

\i\Critical\p\, \i\Alarm\p\, and \i\Warning\p\ - the threshold to be used for comparison for each severity. Thresholds may be positive or negative numbers.

\i\Legend\p\ - a text string used to identify the variable in the status window and in strip charts. If left blank, the variable's name or OID is used.

\i\Units\p\ - a text string displayed next to the variable's value in the Status Window. Usually used for units of measure (packets/sec, degrees, etc.) 

\i\Tag\p\ - A short text string that identifies a particular class of dataset. Tags are used to correlate different variables from different probes that describe the same type of data, such as CPU% or temperature.

-- Parameters are user-settable values that the probe uses for its comparisons.
-- Specify the default values here. The customer can change them and they will be retained for each device.
