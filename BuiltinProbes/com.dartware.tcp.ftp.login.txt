\GB\File Transfer Protocol (Login)\P\

The standard protocol for transferring files on TCP/IP internets, as defined in \U2=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0959.txt\RFC 959\P0\.  The default TCP port number for FTP control connections is port 21.

This TCP probe connects to the FTP server's control port (21). It then logs in using the specified User ID and Password and issues a NOOP command. If the connection is successful, the probe issues the QUIT command and sets the status to \b\Okay\p\.

\i\User ID\p\ - the account name used to login to the FTP server.

\i\Password\p\ - the account password used to verify the User ID's identity.

\b\Note:\p\  If the probe queries the FTP server often, and at regular intervals, the FTP server's log files contain a succession of "Login" and "Logout" log lines.
