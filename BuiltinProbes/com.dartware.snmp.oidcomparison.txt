	Test an OID for Equality (com.dartware.snmp.oidcomparison.txt)
    Custom Probe for InterMapper (http://www.intermapper.com)
    Please feel free to use this as a base for further development.

	 3 Jul 2007 Modified from Single OID Viewer -reb
	 5 May 2008 Added autorecord section -cls
	22 Apr 2009 Added clear-exists flag to handle the case where the variable doesn't
	            exist anymore, and clean up messages to identify that situation. -dns
	23 Sep 2011	Cast OID to chartable. -cls
	 4 Sep 2012 Modified datasets section to interpolate parameters for Tag, Units, and Legend. -jpd
	 4 Apr 2013 - Edited description for User Guide (via Probe Doc Generator) -bobm

\GB\Comparison Probe\P\

This probe retrieves a single SNMP MIB variable, compares it to a specified value, and uses the result to set the device's status. It also displays the value in the Status Window.

\b\Parameters\p\

\i\Variable\p\ - the MIB name or OID to retrieve. If you have imported the MIB for this device, enter the symbolic name for this value. Otherwise, enter its OID. 

\i\Test\p\ - Choose whether to set the status to ALARM if the device is \b\Equal\p\ or \b\NotEqual\p\ to the \i\Value\p\ parameter. 

\i\Value\p\ - The value to compare against.

\i\Severity\p\ - The status to use if the comparison fails. 

\i\Legend\p\ - A text string used to identify the variable in the status window and any strip charts. If left blank, the variable's name or OID is used.

\i\Units\p\ - optional - A text string that is displayed next to the value in the Status Window, intended for use as a unit of measure (packets/sec, degrees, etc.) 

\i\Tag\p\ - A short text string that identifies a particular class of dataset. Tags are used to correlate different variables from different probes that describe the same type of data, such as CPU% or temperature.

-- Parameters are user-settable values that the probe uses for its comparisons.
-- Specify the default values here. The customer can change them and they will be retained for each device.
