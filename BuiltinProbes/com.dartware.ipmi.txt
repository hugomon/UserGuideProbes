\GB\Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI 2.0)\P\

This probe implements version 2.0 of the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) over a LAN. It sends UDP-based RMCP+ packets to a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) located within a server or workstation. The BMC is hardware which permits network-based management of the computer even when it is turned off, i.e. "lights-out management".

\b\Parameters\p\

\i\User\p\ - required - An administrator-level user name to the BMC.

\i\Password\p\ - required - The password for the specified user.

\i\Dialect\p\ - The variant of the IPMI protocol. There are subtle differences in implementations of IPMI in various products. 
* To use this probe with an Apple XServe 2008 or earlier, set the "Dialect" parameter to "XServe". 
* For Dell Servers, the Apple XServe 2009, and any other product set the "Dialect" parameter to "Other".

This probe supports one-key, non-anonymous logins only. Internally, it uses RAKP-HMAC-SHA1 and AES-CBS-128 for authentication and confidentiality, respectively. The firewall configuration of the BMC must permit UDP packets from InterMapper.
