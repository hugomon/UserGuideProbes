\GB\Hypertext Transfer Protocol over SSL/TLS (HTTPS) - Post Form Results\P\

The protocol used for secure transfer of web pages on the World Wide Web. The default TCP port number for HTTPS connections is port 443.

This TCP probe lets you post form results to a specific web CGI over a secure connection.

\b\Parameters\p\

\i\Host Name\p\ - the domain name of the web server (Example: "www.intermapper.com"). This can be derived from the host name part of the URL that you want to test. You must enter a valid \i\Host Name\p\ to test a web server that implements a virtual host. Add only an IP address or domain name; do not add "http://".

\i\URL Path\p\ - the full path of the desired file on the web server (Example: "/index.html"). The first character must be a '/'.

\i\Form Data\p\ - the encoded data sent in the body of the POST message.

\i\String to verify\p\ - a string to verify in the server's response. For example, if you post form data that is designed to generate an error response, you might search for "sorry" or "could not be processed" to verify that the CGI is properly rejecting the data. If the string is not found, the device goes into \b\Alarm\p\.

\b\Note:\p\ The implementation of this probe uses OpenSSL on MacOSX.
