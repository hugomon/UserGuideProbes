\GB\Flow Exporter Status\P\

This probe monitors a Flow Exporter and reports statistics about Flow activity. It does this by retrieving information from the InterMapper Flows server.

The normal state of the device is UP/OKAY. There are two error conditions:

* If the monitored device does not appear to be a Flow Exporter (it is not listed by InterMapper Flows), the status of the device is set to CRITICAL.  

* If the InterMapper Flows server has received no flow records during a poll interval, the status of the device is set to DOWN.

\b\Parameters\p\

None.
