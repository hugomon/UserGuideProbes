\GB\File Transfer Protocol (No Login)\P\

The standard protocol for transferring files on TCP/IP internets, as defined in \U2=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0959.txt\RFC 959\P0\.  The default TCP port number for FTP control connections is port 21.

This TCP script connects to the FTP server's control port (21). It then issues a NOOP command without logging in. If the connection is successful, the probe issues the QUIT command and sets the status to \b\Okay\p\.

\b\Note:\p\ Use this script if you are going to be probing the FTP server frequently. Unlike the FTP (login) probe, this probe does generate numerous entries in your FTP logs.
